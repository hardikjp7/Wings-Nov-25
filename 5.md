## **Topic 17: Dual Axis & Combined Charts**

### **What is a Dual Axis Chart?**

**Dual Axis** = Two measures plotted on the same chart with **separate Y-axes** (left and right)

**Why use dual axis?**
✅ Compare measures with different scales
✅ Show correlation between two metrics
✅ Overlay different mark types (bars + lines)
✅ Create advanced visualizations (bullet graphs, Gantt charts)

**Example Use Cases:**
- Sales (bars) and Profit Margin (line) over time
- Actual vs Target comparison
- Temperature and Rainfall on same chart
- Quantity sold (bars) with Price (line)

---

### **Creating a Dual Axis Chart**

**Method 1: Drag to Opposite Axis**
1. Drag first measure to Rows
2. Drag second measure to Rows (creates two separate charts)
3. Right-click second measure pill → **Dual Axis**
4. Charts overlay with two Y-axes

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**
1. Create chart with first measure
2. Drag second measure and drop on right side of view (when you see ruler icon)
3. Automatic dual axis

**Method 3: Ctrl+Drag (Duplicate)**
1. Place measure on Rows
2. Ctrl+Drag same measure to Rows (duplicates it)
3. Right-click second → **Dual Axis**
4. Edit one to different aggregation/calculation

---

### **Dual Axis Interface**

**Once created:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Sales (left) | Profit (right)│
│                                     │
│  ████     ████                      │
│  ████     ████        ___           │
│  ████     ████       /   \          │
│  ████     ████      /     \___      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
  Bars use left axis, Line uses right
```

**Two Marks Cards appear!**
- One for each measure
- Independent formatting
- Different mark types possible

---

### **Synchronizing Axes** ⭐ **IMPORTANT!**

**Problem:** By default, each axis has independent scale
```
Left axis: 0 - 100,000 (Sales)
Right axis: 0 - 20,000 (Profit)
```
Can visually mislead!

**Solution: Synchronize Axes**
1. Right-click on one axis → **Synchronize Axis**
2. Both axes now share same scale (0 - 100,000)

**When to synchronize:**
- Measures in same units (both currency)
- Want true visual comparison
- Avoid misleading viewers

**When NOT to synchronize:**
- Different units (Temperature °F vs Rainfall inches)
- Vastly different scales (one is millions, other is percentages)
- Want to see both trends clearly

---

### **Editing Individual Measures on Dual Axis**

**Each measure has separate Marks Card:**

**Top Marks Card** = First measure (SUM(Sales))
- Can set to Bar, Line, Circle, etc.
- Independent color, size, label

**Bottom Marks Card** = Second measure (SUM(Profit))
- Different mark type
- Different formatting

**"All" Marks Card** = Applies to both

---

### **Common Dual Axis Combinations**

**1. Bars + Line**
```
Sales as Bars (quantity/volume)
Profit Margin as Line (percentage/rate)
```
**Setup:**
- Sales → Bars mark type
- Profit Margin → Line mark type
- DON'T synchronize (different units)

---

**2. Line + Line**
```
Actual Sales vs Target Sales
```
**Setup:**
- Both as lines
- Different colors
- Synchronize axes (same units)

---

**3. Circle + Line**
```
Individual data points + Trend line
```
**Setup:**
- Raw data as circles
- Trend/average as line overlay

---

**4. Area + Line**
```
Cumulative total (area) + Daily rate (line)
```

---

### **Practical Example: Sales vs Profit Margin**

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Drag Order Date to Columns** (continuous, by month)
2. **Drag Sales to Rows** → Creates line chart
3. **Create calculated field: Profit Margin**
   ```
   SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])
   ```
4. **Drag Profit Margin to Rows** → Second chart below
5. **Right-click Profit Margin pill → Dual Axis**
6. **Format:**
   - SUM(Sales) Marks Card → Bar, Blue color
   - AGG(Profit Margin) Marks Card → Line, Orange color
   - Format Profit Margin axis as Percentage
7. **Optional:** Don't synchronize (Sales in $, Margin in %)

**Result:** Bars show sales volume, line shows profitability trend

---

### **Blended Axis vs Dual Axis**

**Dual Axis:**
- Two separate Y-axes (left and right)
- Can have different scales
- Measures can be in different units

**Blended Axis (Measure Names/Values):**
- Single shared axis
- All measures must use same scale
- Simpler for similar measures

We'll cover Measure Names/Values approach later in this topic.

---

### **Dual Axis Best Practices**

✅ **DO:**
- Use different mark types for clarity (bar + line)
- Label axes clearly
- Synchronize when measures comparable
- Use color to distinguish measures
- Add legend

❌ **DON'T:**
- Mislead with unsynchronized axes of same unit
- Overcomplicate with too many overlays
- Use when simple side-by-side is clearer
- Forget to label which axis is which

---

### **Combined Charts (Multiple Mark Types)**

**You can layer multiple mark types without dual axis:**

**Method: Measure Names/Values**

**Setup:**
1. Drag Measure Names to Filters → Select measures to include
2. Drag Measure Names to Color/Marks Card
3. Drag Measure Values to Rows
4. Each measure appears as separate line/bar

**Different from Dual Axis:**
- Single shared axis
- All measures same scale
- Cleaner when measures similar

---

### **Creating Combination Charts**

**Example: Multiple Products on One Chart**

**Automatic (Show Me):**
1. Select dimension and 2+ measures
2. Click "Combo" chart in Show Me
3. Tableau decides optimal combination

**Manual (More control):**
1. Create view with multiple measures
2. Click on individual measure on Marks Card
3. Change mark type independently

---

### **Advanced: Bullet Graph** ⭐ **Common in Business**

**Bullet Graph** = Compact way to show Actual vs Target with ranges

**Components:**
- Bar (Actual value)
- Line (Target/Goal)
- Background shading (Good/Fair/Poor ranges)

**How to create:**
1. Place dimension on Rows
2. Place Actual on Columns (Bar)
3. Place Target on Columns (Dual axis)
4. Change Target to Line
5. Add reference distribution for ranges (next topic)

**Or use Show Me:**
- Select dimension + 2 measures
- Click Bullet Graph in Show Me

---

### **Advanced: Gantt Chart with Duration**

**Gantt Chart** = Timeline visualization (project management)

**Setup:**
1. Drag Start Date to Columns (continuous)
2. Drag Task Name to Rows
3. Change mark type to **Gantt Bar**
4. Drag Duration to Size
5. Optional: Color by Status

**Dual Axis Enhancement:**
- Add milestones as second measure
- Show as shapes on timeline

---

### **Troubleshooting Dual Axis**

**Problem: "Can't see second measure"**
- Solution: Check mark types - might be hidden behind
- Try line + bar instead of bar + bar

**Problem: "Dual Axis option grayed out"**
- Solution: Must have 2+ measures on Rows/Columns
- Can't dual axis with dimensions

**Problem: "Axes showing weird scales"**
- Solution: Edit axis → Fixed start/end
- Or synchronize if appropriate

**Problem: "Can't tell measures apart"**
- Solution: Use different colors, mark types
- Add labels, legend

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** Show monthly sales (bars) with profit margin % (line) overlaid. Best approach?
- A) Two separate charts
- B) Dual axis with synchronized axes
- C) Dual axis with independent axes ✅
- D) Measure Names/Values

**Why?** Different units ($ vs %) need independent axes. Dual axis allows overlay with separate scales.

---

**Q2:** You create dual axis but can't see second measure. Most likely cause?
- A) Wrong aggregation
- B) Both measures same mark type hiding each other ✅
- C) Need to synchronize
- D) Missing filter

**Why?** If both are bars, they overlap. Change one to line or adjust mark types.

---

**Q3:** When should you synchronize dual axes?
- A) Always
- B) Never
- C) When measures have same units and comparable scale ✅
- D) Only for line charts

**Why?** Synchronizing with different units/scales can mislead. Only when truly comparable.

## **Topic 18: Reference Lines & Trend Lines**

### **What are Reference Lines?**

**Reference Line** = Visual indicator showing a specific value or statistical measure

**Types:**
- **Line** - Horizontal or vertical line at specific value
- **Band** - Shaded area between two values
- **Distribution** - Shows data spread (confidence intervals, percentiles)
- **Box Plot** - Statistical summary

**Common uses:**
✅ Show targets, goals, thresholds
✅ Indicate averages, medians
✅ Highlight acceptable ranges
✅ Show statistical distributions

---

### **Adding Reference Lines**

- Example: Average per category per region

**Visual Example:**
```
Table scope:
├─────────────────────────────┤ One line across everything

Pane scope:
Category A: ├──────────┤ Line for A
Category B: ├──────────┤ Line for B
Category C: ├──────────┤ Line for C

Cell scope:
         East    West

Useful for profit charts showing positive/negative split

---

### **Reference Bands**

**Reference Band** = Shaded area between two values

**Common uses:**
- Acceptable range (min-max)
- Confidence intervals
- Target range (80-120% of goal)

**How to create:**
1. Analytics pane → Drag **Reference Band**
2. Choose scope
3. Configure **From** and **To** values

**Example: Target Range**
```
From: Constant (45000) - Lower target
To: Constant (55000) - Upper target
Fill: Light green
Label: "Target Range"
```

---

### **Distribution Bands**

**Distribution** = Shows statistical spread of data

**Types:**
- **Percentages** - 60%, 80%, 95% of data
- **Percentiles** - 25th-75th percentile (IQR)
- **Standard Deviation** - ±1 SD, ±2 SD
- **Quantiles** - Quartiles, quintiles

**How to create:**
1. Analytics pane → Drag **Distribution**
2. Choose type
3. Configure shading

**Example: Standard Deviation**
```
±1 SD: Light gray (68% of data)
±2 SD: Lighter gray (95% of data)
```

**Visual:**
```
        ├─────────────────────┤  ±2 SD
          ├───────────────┤      ±1 SD
              ├───────┤          Mean ±0.5 SD
                 │               Mean line
```

---

### **Box Plots** ⭐

---

### **Trend Lines** ⭐ **VERY COMMON IN EXAMS!**

**Trend Line** = Line showing overall pattern/direction in data

**Models available:**
- **Linear** - Straight line (most common)
- **Logarithmic** - Logarithmic curve
- **Exponential** - Exponential growth/decay
- **Polynomial** - Curved line (degree 2-8)
- **Power** - Power function

---

### **Adding Trend Lines**

---

### **Trend Line Configuration**

**Right-click trend line → Edit Trend Lines**

**Options:**

**1. Model Type:**
- Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, etc.
- "Allow a trend line per color" - Separate trend per category

**2. Show confidence bands:**
- 95%, 99% confidence intervals
- Shaded area around trend line

**3. Force y-intercept to zero:**
- Trend line must pass through (0,0)

**4. Show recalculated line for highlighted or selected data points:**
- Dynamic trend line when filtering

---

### **Trend Line Statistics**

**Hover over trend line:**
Shows:
- **Equation** - y = mx + b (for linear)
- **R-squared** - Goodness of fit (0-1, higher = better)
- **P-value** - Statistical significance

**Example:**
```
Linear Trend Line:
y = 1,234.5x + 5,678.9
R² = 0.87  (Good fit)
P < 0.0001 (Highly significant)
```

---

### **R-squared Interpretation** ⭐ **EXAM IMPORTANT!**

**R² = 1.0** → Perfect fit (100% variance explained)
**R² = 0.8** → Good fit (80% variance explained)
**R² = 0.5** → Moderate fit
**R² = 0.2** → Weak fit
**R² = 0.0** → No linear relationship

**P-value:**
- **P < 0.05** → Statistically significant trend
- **P > 0.05** → May be random, not reliable

---

### **Trend Lines by Category**

**"Allow a trend line per color"** checkbox:

**Checked:**
- Separate trend for each colored category
- Example: Trend per product category

**Unchecked:**
- Single trend across all data
- Ignores category breaks

**Visual:**
```
Checked (separate):
Furniture: ╱╱╱╱
Technology: ──────
Supplies: ╲╲╲╲

Unchecked (single):
All categories: ───
```

---

### **Forecast Lines** (Related concept)

**Forecast** = Predict future values based on historical data

**How to add:**
1. Analytics pane → Drag **Forecast** to view
2. Extends line into future
3. Shows confidence intervals

**Requirements:**
- Time dimension (Date)
- At least some historical data
- Continuous date field

**Configuration:**
- **Forecast length** - How many periods ahead
- **Ignore last** - Exclude recent anomalies
- **Show confidence bands** - Prediction interval

*More on forecasting in advanced topics*

---

### **Combining Reference Lines and Trend Lines**

**You can have both!**

**Example: Sales over time**
- Trend line - Shows growth trajectory
- Average reference line - Shows mean sales
- Target reference line - Shows goal

**Each serves different purpose:**
- Trend = Direction
- Average = Central value
- Target = Objective

---

### **Practical Examples**

**1. Sales Performance Dashboard**
```
Metric: Monthly Sales (line chart)
+ Average reference line (dashed, gray)
+ Target reference line (solid, red at $50K)
+ Linear trend line (blue)
Result: See if trend is toward target
```

---

**2. Profit Analysis**
```
Metric: Profit by Product (bar chart)
+ Zero reference line (black, horizontal)
+ Median reference band (pane scope, each category)
Result: Identify profitable vs unprofitable products
```

---

**3. Distribution Analysis**
```
Metric: Order values (scatter plot)
+ Box plot overlay
+ ±2 SD distribution bands
Result: Identify outliers and data spread
```

---

**4. Quality Control**
```
Metric: Manufacturing defect rate (line over time)
+ Upper control limit (UCL) reference line
+ Lower control limit (LCL) reference line
+ Average reference line
Result: Monitor process stability
```

---

### **Reference Lines Best Practices**

✅ **DO:**
- Use consistent colors (red for bad, green for good)
- Label clearly
- Choose appropriate scope
- Keep it simple (max 2-3 lines)
- Use dashed lines for references, solid for actuals

❌ **DON'T:**
- Overload with too many reference lines
- Use bright colors that overwhelm data
- Forget to label what lines represent
- Mix scopes confusingly

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** Show average sales for each region separately on a bar chart. Which reference line scope?
- A) Table
- B) Pane ✅
- C) Cell
- D) Per dimension

**Why?** Pane scope creates one line per region (pane). Table would be one line across all regions.

---

**Q2:** You add a trend line and R² = 0.23. What does this mean?
- A) Perfect fit
- B) Good fit
- C) Weak fit, trend may not be reliable ✅
- D) No relationship

**Why?** R² of 0.23 means only 23% variance explained - weak relationship, trend line may not be meaningful.

---

**Q3:** Show acceptable sales range ($40K-$60K) as shaded area. What to use?
- A) Reference line
- B) Reference band ✅
- C) Distribution
- D) Trend line

**Why?** Reference band shades area between two values. Reference line is single value.

---

**Q4:** You want separate trend lines for each product category. What to enable?
- A) Pane scope
- B) "Allow a trend line per color" ✅
- C) Multiple axes
- D) Distribution per category

**Why?** Checkbox "Allow trend line per color" creates separate trends when categories are on Color.

---

## **Practice Exercises:**

**Exercise 1: Dual Axis**
1. Create monthly sales trend (line)
2. Add profit margin % as second axis (line, different color)
3. Don't synchronize axes
4. Format profit margin as percentage

**Exercise 2: Reference Lines**
1. Create sales by category bar chart
2. Add average reference line (table scope)
3. Add target line at $50,000
4. Add median reference line (pane scope) to compare each category to its median

**Exercise 3: Trend Line**
1. Create sales over time line chart
2. Add linear trend line
3. Enable confidence bands
4. Check R² value - is trend reliable?

**Exercise 4: Combination**
1. Create quarterly sales (bars)
2. Add trend line
3. Add target reference line
4. Add average reference band (shaded)
