# Module 4: Advanced Visualizations - Detailed Hands-On Notes

## 1. Dual Axis Charts

### What is a Dual Axis Chart?
Two measures plotted on the same chart with separate axes (left and right)

**When to use:**
- Compare measures with different scales (Sales vs Profit Margin %)
- Show trend line with bars
- Overlay different mark types
- Compare actuals vs targets

---

### A. Creating Dual Axis Charts

**Method 1: Drag and Drop**
```
Steps:
1. Drag first measure to Rows (e.g., Sales)
2. Drag second measure to Rows (next to first)
3. Right-click second measure pill → "Dual Axis"
4. Two axes appear (left and right)
```

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Show Sales (bars) and Profit (line) over time

Steps:
1. Order Date (Month) on Columns
2. Sales on Rows
3. Profit on Rows (creates second chart below)
4. Right-click "Profit" pill → Dual Axis
5. Charts merge with dual axes
6. Click "Sales" Marks card → Change to Bar
7. Click "Profit" Marks card → Change to Line
```

---

**Method 2: Drop on Opposite Axis**
```
Steps:
1. Drag first measure to Rows
2. Hold second measure and drop on right axis (opposite side)
3. Automatically creates dual axis
```

---

### B. Synchronizing Axes

**Why synchronize?**
- Makes scales comparable
- Both axes show same range
- More accurate visual comparison

**How to synchronize:**
```
Steps:
1. Right-click one of the axes
2. Select "Synchronize Axis"
3. Both axes now show same scale
```

**Note:** Can only synchronize axes with same units (both currency, both percentages, etc.)

---

### C. Formatting Dual Axis Charts

**Different Mark Types:**
```
Each measure has its own Marks card

Example setup:
- Sales Marks card: Bar, Blue color
- Profit Marks card: Line, Orange color, Size increased

Steps:
1. Select "Sales" from Marks card dropdown
2. Change type to Bar
3. Change color to Blue
4. Select "Profit" from dropdown
5. Change type to Line
6. Change color to Orange
```

---

**Layering Order:**
```
Control which measure appears on top:

Steps:
1. Look at Marks card stack
2. Top measure draws last (appears on top)
3. Drag cards to reorder
4. Or: Right-click measure pill → "Move to front/back"
```

---

**Hide One Axis:**
```
For cleaner look:

Steps:
1. Right-click axis to hide
2. Uncheck "Show Header"
3. Only one axis visible, but both measures still shown
```

---

### D. Combination Chart (Bar + Line)

**Classic Use Case: Sales and Profit Margin**
```
Task: Bars for Sales, Line for Profit Margin %

Steps:
1. Order Date (Month) on Columns
2. Sales on Rows
3. Calculated field: Profit Margin = [Profit]/[Sales]
4. Drag Profit Margin to Rows (dual axis)
5. Sales Marks: Bar, Blue
6. Profit Margin Marks: Line, Orange, add markers
7. Right-click Profit Margin axis → Format → Percentage
8. Do NOT synchronize (different scales)
```

**Result:** Easy visual correlation between sales volume and profitability

---

### E. Actual vs Target (Dual Axis)

**Setup with two measures:**
```
Task: Show actual sales vs target with variance

Data structure:
- Actual Sales column
- Target Sales column

Steps:
1. Order Date (Month) on Columns
2. SUM(Actual Sales) on Rows - Bar, Blue
3. SUM(Target Sales) on Rows - Line, Red with markers
4. Right-click second measure → Dual Axis
5. Right-click axis → Synchronize Axis

Enhancement - Add variance:
Create calculated field:
Variance = [Actual Sales] - [Target Sales]
Drag to Color on Actual Sales marks card
Red for below target, Green for above
```

---

### F. Bullet Graph Alternative

**Using dual axis for bullet graph effect:**
```
Task: Show sales vs target as overlapping bars

Steps:
1. Category on Rows
2. SUM(Sales) on Columns
3. SUM(Target) on Columns (dual axis)
4. Synchronize axes
5. Sales Marks: Bar, Gray, Size smaller (70%)
6. Target Marks: Bar, Blue, Size larger (100%)
7. Move Target to back (appears behind Sales)

Result: Target bar shows as background, sales bar overlays
- Sales exceeds target: Blue bar fully visible
- Sales below target: Gray shows beyond blue
```

---

## 2. Heat Maps

### What is a Heat Map?
Uses color intensity to show measure values across two dimensions

**When to use:**
- Show patterns across categories

```

---

**Custom Range:**
```
Set specific start/end points:

Steps:
1. Edit Colors → Advanced
2. Check "Start" → Enter minimum value
3. Check "End" → Enter maximum value
4. Check "Center" for diverging colors

Example: Profit
- Start: -1000 (red)
- Center: 0 (white)
- End: 1000 (green)
```

---

### C. Highlight Tables

**What's the difference?**
- Heat Map: Color only
- Highlight Table: Color + Text

**Creating Highlight Table:**
```
Steps:
1. Create heat map as above

- Sales Quota (measure)

Steps:
1. Sales Rep to Rows
2. Actual Sales to Columns (Bar)
3. Analytics → Reference Line → Cell
4. Value: AVG(Sales Quota)
5. Line: Thick, Red
6. Label: None

Add performance ranges:
7. Analytics → Reference Distribution
8. 60% to 80% of quota: Red (Below Expectations)
9. 80% to 100%: Yellow (Meets Expectations)
10. 100%+: Green (Exceeds Expectations)
```

---

**Color coding bars:**
```
Make bars change color based on achievement:

Create calculated field:
Name: Performance Status
Formula:
IF SUM([Actual Sales]) >= SUM([Sales Quota]) THEN "Exceeds"
ELSEIF SUM([Actual Sales]) >= SUM([Sales Quota]) * 0.9 THEN "Meets"
ELSE "Below"
END

Drag to Color on bar marks card
```

---

### C. Multiple Bullet Graphs

**Dashboard of KPIs:**

```

---

### D. Advanced Bullet Graph Features

**Actual, Target, and Last Year:**
```
Three-way comparison:

Steps:
1. Actual as main bar
2. Target as reference line (thick)
3. Last Year as thinner bar (different color)
4. Or Last Year as second reference line (dashed)

Shows:
- Current performance
- Goal
- Historical comparison
```

---

**Segmented ranges:**
```
More detailed performance bands:

Ranges as % of target:
- 0-50%: Dark Red (Critical)
- 50-75%: Red (Poor)
- 75-90%: Yellow (Fair)
- 90-110%: Green (Good)
- 110%+: Dark Green (Excellent)

Steps:
1. Create 5 reference distributions
2. Each with specific range
3. Different colors and transparency
4. Layer back to front (darkest first)
```

---

### E. Bullet Graph Best Practices

**Visual Design:**
```
✓ Use neutral color for bar (dark gray)
✓ Target line should be prominent (red or black, thick)
✓ Ranges should be subtle (light colors, transparent)
✓ Keep ranges to 3-5 maximum
✓ Align multiple bullet graphs for comparison
✓ Include actual values in labels
```

---

**Label formatting:**
```
Steps:
1. SUM(Actual) to Label
2. Click Label → Format
3. Currency or appropriate format
4. Adjust size and position

Optional - add target to label:
Label content:
Actual: <SUM(Actual)>
Target: <SUM(Target)>
Achievement: <SUM(Actual)/SUM(Target)>
```

Top of box (Q3): 75th percentile
Line in box: Median (50th percentile)
Bottom of box (Q1): 25th percentile
Bottom whisker: Lowest value (within range)
Circles above/below: Outliers
```

---

**What it reveals:**
```
Wide box: High variability in middle 50%
Narrow box: Data concentrated around median
Median near top of box: Negative skew
Median near bottom: Positive skew
Many outliers: Long tail distribution
Symmetrical: Normal distribution
```

---

### C. Customizing Box Plots

**Show underlying data:**
```
Add individual points:

Steps:
1. Drag measure to Rows again (creates second chart)
2. Change to Circle marks
3. Adjust size and transparency
4. Shows all data points with box overlay

Or use jitter:
5. Add small random offset so points don't overlap
6. Create calc: [Sales] + (RANDOM() - 0.5) * 100
```

---

**Color by category:**
```
Steps:
1. Drag Category (or another dim) to Color
2. Each box different color
3. Makes comparison easier
4. Can also show sub-categories within main category
```

---

**Annotations:**
```
Label key values:

Steps:
1. Click specific box element (median line, quartile, etc.)
2. Right-click → Annotate → Mark
3. Add text explaining the value
4. Useful for presentations
```

---

### D. Multiple Box Plots

- Outliers indicate problem batches
```

---

**Salary Analysis:**
```
Compensation distribution:
- Department on Columns
- Salary on Rows
- Shows pay ranges
- Identifies outliers (very high/low salaries)
- Compare equity across departments
```

---

**Customer Behavior:**
```
Purchase patterns:
- Customer Segment on Columns
- Order Value on Rows
- Shows typical spending

- Overlapping bars = overallocated
- Gaps = available capacity
```

---

**Adding capacity line:**
```
Show max tasks per person:

Steps:
1. Analytics → Reference Line
2. Add to row level
3. Value: Maximum concurrent tasks (e.g., 2)
4. If more than 2 bars overlap = problem
```

---

## 8. Pareto Charts (Combo with Running Total)

### What is a Pareto Chart?
Bar chart with cumulative line showing 80/20 principle

**When to use:**
- Identify top contributors
- Quality analysis (defect causes)
- Sales analysis (top products)
- Cost optimization

---

### A. Creating Pareto Chart

**Steps:**
```
Task: Show products contributing to 80% of sales

Step 1 - Sort data:
1. Product Name on Rows
2. Sales on Columns
3. Sort descending by Sales

Step 2 - Add bars:
4. Ensure mark type is Bar

Step 3 - Add cumulative line:
5. Drag Sales to Columns again (second measure)
6. Right-click → Quick Table Calculation → Running Total
7. Right-click → Quick Table Calculation → Percent of Total

Step 4 - Create dual axis:
8. Right-click second Sales pill → Dual Axis
9. Right-click right axis → Synchronize Axis

Step 5 - Format:
10. First marks (bars): Blue
11. Second marks (line): Orange, add markers
12. Add reference line at 80%
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Top products contributing to 80% of sales

Steps:
1. Product Name to Rows
2. Sales to Columns (Bar, Blue)
3. Sales to Columns again
4. Right-click 2nd → Running Total
5. Right-click 2nd → Percent of Total
6. 2nd mark type: Line, Orange
7. Dual axis, synchronize
8. Analytics → Reference Line on line chart
9. Value: 0.8 (80%)
10. Dashed red line

Read chart:
- Bars: Individual product sales
- Line: Cumulative percentage
- Products before line crosses 80% = critical 20%
```

---

### B. Highlighting 80% Products

**Add visual indicator:**
```
Create calculated field:
Name: Top 80%
Formula:
RUNNING_SUM(SUM([Sales])) / TOTAL(SUM([Sales])) <= 0.8

Drag to Color on bar marks card:
- TRUE: Orange (Top 80%)
- FALSE: Gray (Bottom 20%)

Makes critical products stand out immediately
```

---

### C. Pareto Chart Variations

**By Category:**
```
Task: Which categories drive 80% of profit?

Steps:
1. Category to Rows (instead of product)
2. Profit to Columns
3. Sort descending
4. Add running total line
5. Reference line at 80%

Quickly identifies focus categories
```

---

**Defect Analysis:**
```
Task: Quality control - defect causes

Data: Defect Type | Count

Steps:
1. Defect Type on Rows (sorted by count descending)
2. Count to Columns (Bar)
3. Count to Columns (Running %, Line)
4. Dual axis, synchronized
5. Reference line at 80%

Result: Shows which defects to fix first
- Top 20% of causes = 80% of problems
- Focus resources here for maximum impact
```

---

## 9. Histogram

### What is a Histogram?
Shows distribution of continuous data in bins/intervals

**When to use:**
- Understand data distribution
- Identify patterns (normal, skewed, bimodal)
- Find outliers
- Statistical analysis

---

### A. Creating Histogram

**Automatic Method:**
```
Steps:
1. Drag Measure to Columns
2. Right-click measure pill → "Create Bins"
3. Dialog appears → Set bin size
4. New binned field created
5. Drag to Rows: CNT(Record count) or COUNT
6. Mark type changes to Bar automatically
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Distribution of order values

Steps:
1. Drag Sales to Columns
2. Right-click "Sales" pill → Create Bins
3. Bin size: 100 (groups orders by $100 increments)
4. New field created: "Sales (bin)"
5. Drag "Sales (bin)" to Rows
6. Drag any field to Rows and change to COUNT
7. Result: Bar chart showing frequency distribution

Interpretation:
- Peak: Most common order value range
- Spread: Variability in orders
- Shape: Normal, skewed, etc.
```

---

### B. Choosing Bin Size

**Guidelines:**
```
Too large: Loses detail, hides patterns
Too small: Too granular, noisy

Rules of thumb:
- Sturges' Rule: Number of bins = 1 + log2(n)
  For 1000 records: ~11 bins
  
- Square Root: Number of bins = √n
  For 1000 records: ~32 bins

Tableau default: Reasonable starting point
Adjust based on visual inspection
```

---

**Manual bin size:**
```
Steps:
1. Right-click binned field → Edit
2. Enter new bin size
3. Click OK
4. Histogram updates

Or create new bin field:
1. Right-click measure → Create → Bins
2. Name it
3. Set size
4. Create multiple with different sizes to compare
```

---

### C. Formatting Histograms

**Remove gaps between bars:**
```
Steps:
1. Format → Borders
2. Row Divider → None
3. Or: Right-click axis → Format
4. Alignment → Range between bars → 0%

Creates continuous appearance
```

---

**Add distribution curve:**
```
Show normal distribution overlay:

Steps:
1. Create histogram as above
2. Duplicate measure on Rows (creates 2nd chart)
3. Change 2nd chart to Line
4. Right-click → Dual Axis
5. Right-click 2nd measure → Add Trend Line
6. Options: Choose Polynomial
7. Adjust curve smoothness

Result: Bars with fitted curve overlay
```

---

### D. Comparative Histograms

**Multiple distributions:**
```
Task: Compare sales distribution by Region

Steps:
1. Sales (bin) on Columns
2. COUNT on Rows
3. Region on Color
4. Creates overlapping histograms

For clearer view:
5. Region on Rows instead of Color
6. Creates small multiples (one histogram per region)
7. Synchronize axes for comparison
```

---

**Side-by-side:**
```
Alternative layout:

Steps:
1. Sales (bin) on Columns
2. Region on Columns (before bins)
3. COUNT on Rows
4. Creates grouped bars

Shows distribution differences clearly
```

---

### E. Histogram Insights

**Identifying patterns:**
```
Normal distribution (bell curve):
- Symmetrical
- Mean ≈ Median
- Most data near center

Right skew (positive):
- Long tail to right
- Mean > Median
- Few high values

Left skew (negative):
- Long tail to left
- Mean < Median
- Few low values

Bimodal:
- Two peaks
- Suggests two different groups
- May need segmentation

Uniform:
- Relatively flat
- All values equally common
```

---

**Finding outliers:**
```
Look for:
- Isolated bars far from main distribution
- Very small bars at extremes
- Gaps in distribution

Example: 
Most orders $0-$500, but one bar at $5000-$5500
Indicates unusual high-value orders to investigate
```

---

## 10. Bump Chart (Rank Over Time)

### What is a Bump Chart?
Shows ranking changes over time with connecting lines

**When to use:**
- Track rank changes
- Competition analysis
- Performance tracking
- League standings

---

### A. Creating Bump Chart

**Steps:**
```
Task: Product ranking by sales over quarters

Step 1 - Create rank calculation:
Name: Sales Rank
Formula: RANK_UNIQUE(SUM([Sales]), 'desc')
Make it table calculation: Compute Using Quarter

Step 2 - Build visualization:
1. Order Date (Quarter) on Columns
2. Sales Rank on Rows
3. Product Name on Color
4. Mark type: Line
5. Add markers (Circle on marks card)

Step 3 - Format:
6. Right-click Rows axis → Edit Axis
7. Check "Reversed" (Rank 1 at top)
8. Set range: Fixed 1 to 10 (top 10 products)
9. Add Product Name to Label (on markers only)
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Track top 5 categories by sales monthly

Steps:
1. Create calc:
   Name: Category Rank
   RANK_UNIQUE(SUM([Sales]), 'desc')

2. Order Date (Month) to Columns
3. Category Rank to Rows
4. Category to Color and Label
5. Mark: Line with circles
6. Reverse Y-axis (Rank 1 at top)
7. Filter: Category Rank <= 5

Result: Lines move up/down showing rank changes
- Crossing lines = positions swapped
- Flat line = stable ranking
```

---

### B. Formatting Bump Chart

**Emphasis on leaders:**
```
Highlight #1 rank:

Create calc:
Name: Is Leader
Formula: [Sales Rank] = 1

Drag to:
- Size: Make leader line thicker
- Color: Leader different color
- Or use in tooltip
```

---

**Color strategy:**
```
Option 1: Color by entity (Product/Category)
- Each line unique color
- Easy to follow individual paths
- Use color legend

Option 2: Color by final rank
- Gradient from top (green) to bottom (red)
- Shows where entities ended up

Option 3: Color by change
- Green: Improved rank
- Red: Declined rank
- Gray: Stayed same
```

---

### C. Interactive Bump Chart

**Highlighting:**
```
Steps:
1. Create bump chart as above
2. Select specific line
3. Right-click → "Keep Only" or "Exclude"
4. Or use Action filter in dashboard

Result: Focus on specific competitors
```

---

**Parameter for top N:**
```
Create parameter:
Name: Top N
Data type: Integer
Current value: 10
Range: 1 to 20

Create calc:
Name: Top N Filter
Formula: [Sales Rank] <= [Top N]

Drag to Filters, select TRUE
Show parameter control

Users can adjust how many ranks to show
```

---

## 11. Lollipop Chart

### What is a Lollipop Chart?
Alternative to bar chart - line with circle at end

**When to use:**
- Less visual clutter than bars
- Focus on specific values

```
Steps:
1. Drag Dimension to Rows (e.g., Product Name)
2. Drag Measure to Columns (e.g., Sales)
3. Duplicate measure (drag to Columns again)
4. First marks: Bar (thin, 1-2 pixels)
5. Second marks: Circle (larger size)
6. Right-click 2nd measure → Dual Axis
7. Synchronize axes

Result: Thin line (stick) with circle (lollipop) at value
```

---

**Method 2: Using Reference Line**
```
Steps:
1. Product Name to Rows
2. Sales to Columns
3. Mark type: Circle (large size)
4. Analytics → Reference Line → Cell
5. Value: 0
6. Line extends from 0 to circle

Creates lollipop effect automatically
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Sales by Sub-Category (lollipop style)

Steps:
1. Sub-Category to Rows
2. Sales to Columns (twice)
3. First measure: Bar, Gray, Size = thinnest
4. Second measure: Circle, Blue, Size = medium
5. Dual axis, synchronized
6. Sort by Sales descending
7. Add value labels on circles

Clean, modern appearance
Easier to read than dense bars
```

---

### B. Formatting Lollipop Charts

**Color coding:**
```
By value (positive/negative):

Create calc:
Name: Profit Sign
Formula: IF [Profit] >= 0 THEN "Positive" ELSE "Negative" END

Drag to Color on circle marks:
- Positive: Green
- Negative: Red

Line stays gray for all
```

---

**Horizontal vs Vertical:**
```
Vertical (default):
- Dimension on Rows, Measure on Columns
- Good for many categories
- Easier to read labels

Horizontal:
- Dimension on Columns, Measure on Rows  
- Swap using toolbar button (Ctrl+W)
- Better for longer category names
```

---

**Dumbbell variation:**
```
Compare two values (e.g., Actual vs Target):

Steps:
1. Dimension to Rows
2. Measure 1 to Columns (Actual)
3. Measure 2 to Columns (Target)
4. Measure Values on Columns
5. Measure Names to Color
6. Mark type: Circle
7. Dual axis, synchronized
8. Add connecting line (use Bar mark between circles)

Shows gap between two values clearly
```

---

## 12. Slope Chart

---

### A. Creating Slope Chart

**Basic Structure:**
```
Steps:
1. Filter date to exactly 2 periods (e.g., 2023 and 2024)
2. Order Date (Year) to Columns (Discrete)
3. Sales to Rows
4. Category (or entity) to Color
5. Mark type: Line
6. Add Circle marks for endpoints
7. Add labels on endpoints
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**

2. Order Date (Quarter) to Columns (Discrete - blue pill)
3. Sales to Rows
4. Product Category to Color and Label
5. Mark type: Line
6. Size: Medium thickness
7. Add markers

Result: Lines show trajectory
- Upward slope: Growth
- Downward: Decline
- Steep: Significant change
- Flat: Stable
```

---

### B. Formatting Slope Chart

**Color by direction:**
```
Create calc:
Name: Change Direction
Formula:
IF LOOKUP(SUM([Sales]), 1) > SUM([Sales]) THEN "Increased"
ELSEIF LOOKUP(SUM([Sales]), 1) < SUM([Sales]) THEN "Decreased"
ELSE "No Change"
END

Configure as table calculation
Drag to Color:
- Increased: Green
- Decreased: Red
- No Change: Gray
```

---

**Emphasis on extremes:**
```
Highlight biggest changes:

Create calc:
Name: Change Amount
Formula: 
LOOKUP(SUM([Sales]), 1) - SUM([Sales])

Create another:
Name: Significant Change
Formula:
ABS([Change Amount]) > 10000

Drag to Size:
- Significant changes: Thicker lines
- Minor changes: Thin lines

Or use in filter to show only significant
```

---

**Labels:**
```

4. Synchronized scales for comparison
5. Filter to 2 time periods for each

Example metrics:
- Sales slope
- Profit slope
- Orders slope
- Customer count slope
```

---

**Ranked slope:**
```
Show rank change instead of value:

Steps:
1. Create RANK calculation
2. Use rank on Rows instead of measure
3. Reverse axis (Rank 1 at top)
4. Shows position changes clearly

Combines slope chart with bump chart concept
```

---

2. From Category to Columns
3. To Category to Columns
4. Measure (flow amount) to Size
5. Mark type: Line
6. Adjust opacity and thickness

Limited but shows directional flow
```

---

### B. Flow Use Cases

**Customer Path:**
```
Data structure:
Source | Destination | Count
Home   | Product     | 1000
Product| Cart        | 600
Cart   | Checkout    | 400
Checkout| Purchase   | 350

Shows drop-off at each stage
Width proportional to volume
```

---

**Budget Allocation:**
```
From: Budget Categories
To: Departments
Width: Dollar Amount

Visualizes how budget flows
Who gets what from where
```

---

- Compare across categories (vertical)
- Spot patterns and anomalies
```

---

**Formatting grid:**
```
Consistent appearance:

Steps:
1. Synchronize all axes
2. Format → Borders → Add cell borders
3. Right-click headers → Format
4. Align titles consistently
5. Use same color scheme throughout

Makes pattern recognition easier
```

---

### C. Sparklines

**Compact trends:**
```
What are sparklines?
- Small, simple charts
- No axes or labels
- Show trend shape only
- Fit in table cells

Creating:
1. Build line chart (Date vs Measure)
2. Remove axes (right-click → Show Header off)
3. Remove gridlines (Format → Lines → None)
4. Small size
5. Place in table with other data

Example in table:
Category | 2024 Sales | Trend
Furniture| $100K      | [sparkline]
Office   | $85K       | [sparkline]
```

---

### D. Best Practices

**When to use:**
```
✓ Same data structure for each multiple
✓ Meaningful comparison across categories
✓ Not too many categories (max 20)
✓ Sufficient screen space
✓ Synchronized scales

✗ Different data structures
✗ Too many categories (overwhelming)
✗ Different scales (misleading)
```

---

## 15. Advanced Combinations

### A. Bar-in-Bar Chart

**Show part within whole:**
```
Task: Actual within Target capacity

Steps:
1. Category on Rows
2. Target to Columns (Bar, Light Gray, Size 100%)
