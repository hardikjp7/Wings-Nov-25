### What is a Dashboard?
A collection of multiple worksheets and supporting information displayed together for analysis and decision-making.

**Key Components:**
- Multiple visualizations (worksheets)
- Interactive filters
- Actions (click to filter)
- Text, images, web content
- Layout containers
- Navigation elements

---

### A. Creating a Dashboard

**Steps:**
```
Method 1: Dashboard Menu
1. Dashboard menu → New Dashboard
2. Or click Dashboard icon (grid) at bottom
3. New dashboard tab appears

Method 2: Quick Creation
1. Click "New Dashboard" button (bottom toolbar)
2. Dashboard automatically created
```

**Dashboard Interface:**
```
Left Panel:
- Sheets (available worksheets)
- Objects (Text, Image, Web Page, etc.)
- Layout containers (Horizontal, Vertical, Blank)

Center: Canvas (where you build)

Bottom: Size selector and device preview
```

---

### B. Adding Worksheets to Dashboard

**Drag and Drop:**
```
Steps:

- Select "Chairs"
- Products shows only chairs
```

---

### E. Filter Formatting

**Customizing Filter Appearance:**
```
Right-click filter → Format

Options:
- Title: Edit text, font, alignment
- Border: Style, color, width
- Background: Color, image
- Shading: Alternating colors
- Font: Size, style, color

Make professional and consistent:
1. All filters same width
2. Consistent fonts
3. Clear titles
4. Appropriate size for content
```

---

**Compact Layout:**
```
Save space:

1. Single Value (dropdown) - Takes minimal space
2. Wildcard Match - Single search box
3. Slider - Compact for numeric/date ranges
4. Hide "All" option if not needed
5. Stack filters in vertical container

For small dashboards or many filters
```

---

## 6. Device-Specific Dashboards

### A. Device Designer

**Purpose:**
Create optimized layouts for different screen sizes

**Accessing:**
```
1. Open dashboard
2. Device Preview toolbar (bottom)
3. Click device type: Desktop, Tablet, Phone
4. Toggle: Default layout or Custom layout
```

---

### B. Creating Device-Specific Layout

**For Tablet:**
```
Steps:
1. Create dashboard (Desktop) first
2. Click "Tablet" in Device Preview
3. Click "Add Tablet Layout"
4. Dashboard duplicates with tablet dimensions
5. Rearrange objects for tablet:
   - Stack instead of side-by-side
   - Larger touch targets
   - Simplified layout
6. Changes only affect tablet view

Desktop layout unchanged
```

---

**For Phone:**
```
Mobile considerations:
- Vertical orientation (portrait)
- Very limited space
- Touch-based interaction

Steps:
1. Click "Phone" in Device Preview
2. Add Phone Layout
3. Simplify drastically:
   - Remove less critical charts
   - Single column layout
   - Larger text
   - Hide detailed tables
   - Keep only key metrics

Result: Usable dashboard on mobile
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Optimize dashboard for 3 devices

Desktop (1200x800):
- 4 charts in 2x2 grid
- Filters on right sidebar
- Detailed tables included

Tablet (1024x768):
- 4 charts in 2x1 vertical stack
- Filters at top (horizontal)
- Tables scrollable

Phone (375x667):
- 2 key charts only (stacked)
- Critical filters only
- Simplified KPIs
- Remove detailed tables

Each optimized for device constraints
```

---

### C. Managing Layouts

**Layout Preview:**
```
Switch between:
1. Device Preview toolbar
2. Click Desktop / Tablet / Phone
3. See how dashboard renders
4. Edit specific layout

Testing:
Preview each before publishing
Ensure usability on all targets
```

---

**Default Layout:**
```
All devices use same layout unless custom created

When to use Default:
- Simple dashboard
- Automatic sizing works well
- Limited development time

When to customize:
- Complex layouts
- Critical mobile experience
- Touch vs mouse interaction differences
```

---

## 7. Dashboard Best Practices

### A. Design Principles

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
1. Most important: Top-left (Western reading pattern)
2. KPIs / Summary: Top
3. Supporting detail: Middle/Bottom
4. Filters: Right side or top
5. Less critical info: Bottom

Size matters:
- Larger = More important
- Smaller = Supporting

Color emphasis:
- Bright/contrasting = Focus
- Muted = Background
```

---

**White Space:**
```
✓ Use padding between objects (10-20px)
✓ Containers with background create sections
✓ Don't cram everything together
✓ Blank objects for intentional spacing

Benefits:
- Easier to scan
- Professional appearance
- Guides eye to key information
```

---

**Consistency:**
```
✓ Consistent color scheme
✓ Same fonts throughout
✓ Aligned objects (use grid)
✓ Similar chart types for similar data
✓ Standard formatting (currency, dates, etc.)

Creates polished, professional look
```

---


### B. Performance Optimization

**Reduce Mark Count:**
```
✓ Limit data to necessary range
✓ Use Top N filters
✓ Aggregate before visualizing
✓ Context filters for large datasets
✓ Hide unnecessary marks

Target: < 10,000 marks total per dashboard
More marks = slower rendering
```

---

**Efficient Calculations:**
```
✓ Row-level calcs faster than LOD expressions
✓ Use extracts instead of live connections
✓ Avoid complex nested LODs
✓ Table calculations on smaller result sets
✓ Pre-calculate in data source when possible

Test performance:
1. Help menu → Settings and Performance → Start Performance Recording
2. Interact with dashboard
3. Stop Recording
4. Review timeline (identify bottlenecks)
```

---

**Dashboard-Specific Tips:**
```
✓ Limit number of worksheets (max 10-12)
✓ Use dashboard actions vs independent filters
✓ Hide unused sheets (not just worksheets)
✓ Disable animations: Format → Animations → Off
✓ Use fixed size over automatic (renders faster)
✓ Minimize web page objects (external dependencies)

Check size: Save as .twbx and review file size
Large file = performance issues
```

---

**Hands-On Testing:**
```
Performance Recording:

Steps:
1. Help → Settings and Performance → Start Performance Recording
2. Open dashboard
3. Interact: Filter, click actions, scroll
4. Stop Recording
5. View Performance Summary

Look for:
- Computing Layouts (slow = too many objects)
- Executing Queries (slow = data source issue)
- Rendering (slow = too many marks)

Fix bottlenecks identified
```

---

### C. Accessibility

**Color Considerations:**
```
✓ Don't rely on color alone to convey info
✓ Use ColorBrewer palettes (colorblind-safe)
✓ Sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.0 guidelines)
✓ Test with colorblind simulator
✓ Combine color with shape/pattern

Example:
Instead of: Green = Good, Red = Bad
Use: Green checkmark = Good, Red X = Bad
```

---

**Text Readability:**
```
✓ Minimum font size: 11pt (dashboard), 13pt+ (mobile)
✓ High contrast: Dark text on light background
✓ Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Segoe UI)
✓ Clear, descriptive titles
✓ Avoid jargon or abbreviations without explanation

Tooltips:
- Provide additional context
- Explain metrics and calculations
- Alternative text for visually impaired users
```

---

**Navigation:**
```
✓ Logical tab order
✓ Clear navigation elements
✓ Keyboard shortcuts work
✓ Screen reader compatible (where possible)
✓ Consistent layout reduces learning curve

Include:
- Dashboard title
- Instructions (if complex)
- Legend/key for symbols
- Data refresh date
```

---

### D. Mobile Optimization

**Mobile-Specific Guidelines:**
```
✓ Simplify: Show only essential metrics
✓ Vertical scrolling OK, horizontal not
✓ Large touch targets (min 44x44 pixels)
✓ Fewer filters (space constrained)
✓ Single-column layout
✓ Test on actual devices

Remove on mobile:
- Complex tables
- Dense scatter plots
- Multiple small charts
- Detailed legends
```

---

**Touch Interactions:**
```
Considerations:
- No "hover" on mobile (use select instead)
- Larger buttons/filters
- Swipe gestures (native to Tableau Mobile)
- Pinch to zoom (maps)

Modify actions:
Desktop: Hover to highlight
Mobile: Select to highlight (no hover available)
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Mobile-optimized sales dashboard

Phone Layout (375x667):
1. Top: Single KPI (Sales Total) - Large, clear
2. Below: Simple bar chart (Top 5 Products)
3. Below: Line chart (Trend - last 30 days)
4. Single filter: Date range (slider)
5. Remove: Detailed tables, scatter plots, complex filters

Format:
- Font sizes 14pt+
- Thick chart lines
- Large markers
- Minimal text
- Touch-friendly filter controls

Test on phone before publishing
```

---

### E. Storytelling

**Dashboard Narrative:**
```
Good dashboard tells a story:

1. Context: What is this about?
   - Clear title
   - Date range
   - Key definitions

2. Main insight: What's the finding?
   - Lead with most important visualization
   - Use size/position to emphasize

3. Supporting evidence: Why does it matter?
   - Detail charts support main point
   - Multiple angles on same story

4. Action: What should user do?
   - Recommendations
   - Next steps
   - Call to action
```

---

**Guiding the User:**
```
Techniques:

1. Visual Flow
   - Z-pattern (Western): Top-left → Top-right → Bottom-left → Bottom-right
   - F-pattern: Top → Down left side → Across when interested

2. Progressive Disclosure
   - Summary first
   - Details on demand (actions)
   - Drill-through for depth

3. Annotations
   - Call out key findings
   - Explain anomalies
   - Provide context

4. Instructions
   - "Click region to filter"
   - "Hover for details"
   - Help tooltip
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Quarterly performance story dashboard

Layout:
1. Header: "Q4 2024 Performance Review"
   - Text: "Strong growth across all regions"

2. Top-left (Primary): Sales trend line
   - Annotation: "15% YoY growth"
   - Reference line: Previous year

3. Top-right: Regional breakdown (bars)
   - Color: Green (exceeds target), Red (below)
   - Clear which regions performed well

4. Middle: Product category treemap
   - Size: Revenue
   - Color: Profit margin
   - Shows where money is made

5. Bottom: Action items (text box)
   - "Focus on West region improvement"
   - "Technology category showing strong momentum"

6. Filters (right):
   - Region (multi-select)
   - Time period (range)

Result: Clear narrative with supporting evidence
User understands key message at a glance
Details available through interaction
```

## 8. Dashboard Legends and Titles

### A. Legend Management

**Show/Hide Legends:**
```
Each worksheet has its own legends (color, size, shape)

Steps:
1. Select worksheet on dashboard
2. Click dropdown on title bar
3. Toggle legends:
   - Legend (Color)
   - Size Legend
   - Shape Legend

Or:
Right-click visualization → Legend → Show/Hide
```

---

**Positioning Legends:**
```
Options:
- Floating: Can place anywhere, overlaps content
- Tiled: Takes up space, moves content

Best practices:
- Right side (common)
- Bottom (for horizontal legends)
- Grouped together (all legends in one area)
- Consistent position across similar dashboards

Format:
Right-click legend → Format
- Font, size, color
- Border, shading
- Title visibility
```

---

**Combining Legends:**
```
Multiple color legends can clutter

Solution:
1. Use consistent field across worksheets
2. Show legend only once on dashboard
3. Hide redundant legends

Example:
5 charts all colored by Region
Show Region legend once (applies to all)
Hide Region legend on other 4 charts
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Clean up legend display

Before:
- 4 charts, each with own Region color legend
- 4 identical legends taking up space

After:
1. Keep legend on first chart (top-left)
2. Select other 3 charts
3. Click dropdown → Hide Legend (Color)
4. Drag remaining legend to right side of dashboard
5. Make legend title clear: "Region"
6. Format: Larger font, border

Result: Single shared legend, more space for data
```

---

### B. Worksheet Titles

**Show/Hide Titles:**
```
Each worksheet has title (sheet name by default)

Steps:
1. Select worksheet on dashboard
2. Click dropdown on title bar
3. Toggle "Title"

2. Edit Title dialog opens
3. Enter text
4. Insert dynamic elements:
   - Field values
   - Parameter values
   - Sheet name
   - Aggregation details

Format:
- Font, size, color, alignment
- Shading, borders

Example dynamic title:
"<Parameters.Metric> by Region for <Parameters.Year>"
Updates automatically with parameter changes
```

---

**Title Best Practices:**
```
✓ Clear and descriptive
✓ Use dynamic text to show context
✓ Consistent formatting across dashboard
✓ Appropriate size (readable but not dominating)
✓ Hide if obvious or redundant

Examples:
Good: "Monthly Sales Trend (2024)"
Bad: "Sheet 1"

Good: "Top 10 Products by Profit"
Bad: "Products"
```

---

**Hands-On Example:**
```
Task: Create informative dynamic title

Setup:
- Parameter: Selected Year (2023, 2024)
- Filter: Region (multi-select)
- Chart: Sales by Month

Title:
"Sales Performance - <Parameters.Selected Year>"

Steps:
1. Double-click chart title
