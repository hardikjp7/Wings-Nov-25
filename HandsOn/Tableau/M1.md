# Module 1: Getting Started with Tableau - Detailed Hands-On Notes

## 1. Connecting to Data Sources

### A. Connecting to Excel Files
**Steps:**
1. Open Tableau Desktop
2. On Start Page, click **"Microsoft Excel"** under Connect
3. Browse and select your Excel file
4. Tableau opens the Data Source page
5. You'll see all sheets/tables on the left panel
6. Drag the desired sheet to the canvas (center area)

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Connect to a sample Sales.xlsx file with multiple sheets
- Preview data in the bottom grid (shows first 1000 rows)
- Notice data types (Abc for String, # for Number, calendar icon for Date, globe for Geographic)

**Exam Tip:** Know how to identify and change data types by clicking the icon above column name

---

### B. Connecting to CSV/Text Files
**Steps:**
1. Click **"Text file"** on Start Page
2. Select your .csv or .txt file
3. Tableau automatically detects delimiters (comma, tab, etc.)
4. Preview loads on Data Source page

**Common Issues:**
- If data looks incorrect, click dropdown arrow on table name → **Field separator** (change delimiter)
- Use **Text File Properties** to adjust encoding (UTF-8, ANSI)

---

### C. Connecting to Databases (SQL Server/MySQL)
**Steps:**
1. Click **"Microsoft SQL Server"** or **"MySQL"** under Connect
2. Enter:
   - **Server:** hostname or IP address
   - **Database:** database name (optional)
   - **Authentication:** Windows/Server authentication
   - **Username/Password** (if required)
3. Click **Sign In**
4. Select database from dropdown
5. Drag tables to canvas

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Try connecting to sample databases (Tableau provides Sample - Superstore)
- Understand difference between selecting specific database vs. searching all databases

---

## 2. Data Source Page Navigation

### Key Areas:
**Left Panel:** Shows all available tables/sheets
**Canvas (Center):** Where you drag tables to create relationships/joins
**Data Grid (Bottom):** Shows preview of data
**Top Menu:** Contains Data Source name, filters, and extract options

### Important Options:
- **Data Source Name:** Click to rename (top-left)
- **Connections:** Shows all connected data sources
- **Sheets:** Lists all worksheets using this data source
- **Edit Connection:** Modify connection settings
- **Refresh:** Updates data preview

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Navigate between Data Source page and Sheet tabs
- Click **"Go to Worksheet"** button (bottom-right) to start visualization
- Return to Data Source by clicking the data source tab

## 3. Live vs Extract Connections

### Live Connection
**What it is:** Direct, real-time connection to data source
**When to use:**
- Data changes frequently
- Small to medium datasets
- Need real-time updates
- Database has good performance

**How to create:**
- Default connection type
- On Data Source page, connection shows "Live" in top-right

**Advantages:**
- Always up-to-date
- No storage space needed
- Reflects latest data

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower performance with large datasets
- Requires active database connection
- Network dependent

---

### Extract Connection
**What it is:** Snapshot of data saved locally as .hyper file
**When to use:**
- Large datasets (millions of rows)
- Slow database connections
- Need offline access
- Better performance required

**How to create:**
1. On Data Source page, click **"Extract"** (top-right corner)
2. Click **"Edit"** to configure extract settings:
   - **Filters:** Add filters to extract subset of data
   - **Aggregation:** Aggregate data for selected dimensions
   - **Top:** Extract only top N rows
   - **Number of Rows:** Specify row limit
   - **Hide unused fields:** Exclude fields not used
3. Click **"Extract"**
4. Choose save location for .hyper file
5. Tableau creates extract (may take time for large data)

**Refreshing Extracts:**
- **Full Refresh:** Replaces entire extract
  - Right-click data source → **Extract** → **Refresh**
- **Incremental Refresh:** Adds only new rows
  - Configure on Data Source page → Extract → Edit → **Incremental Refresh**
  - Requires a date/datetime field

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Connect to Sample-Superstore with Live connection
- Convert to Extract
- Note performance difference
- Refresh extract after modifying source data

**Exam Scenario:**
> Q: You have a 5 million row dataset that updates daily. What's the best approach?
> A: Use Extract with Incremental Refresh configured on the Order Date field.

## 4. Data Interpreter

**What it is:** Tableau's built-in tool to clean Excel data with extra headers, footers, or formatting

**When to use:**
- Excel files with title rows above data
- Summary rows at bottom
- Merged cells
- Multiple sub-tables in one sheet

**How to use:**
1. Connect to Excel file
2. On Data Source page, you'll see **"Data Interpreter"** checkbox (left panel)
3. Check the box
4. Tableau automatically detects and removes unnecessary rows/columns
5. Click **"Review results"** to see what was cleaned

**Hands-On Practice:**
Create a messy Excel file:
```
Company Sales Report
Year: 2024

Product    Sales    Profit
Chairs     1000     200
Tables     1500     300

Total:     2500     500
```

- Connect to this file
- Without Data Interpreter: Shows all rows including headers
- With Data Interpreter: Shows only data rows

**Exam Tip:** Data Interpreter only works with Excel files, not CSV or databases

---

## 5. Unions

**What it is:** Combines tables vertically (stacks rows from multiple tables)

**When to use:**
- Same structure tables from different sheets/files
- Combining monthly data sheets (Jan, Feb, Mar)
- Appending data from multiple sources

### Types of Unions:

**A. Manual Union (Drag & Drop)**
**Steps:**
1. On Data Source page, drag first table to canvas
2. Drag second table BELOW the first table (not beside)
3. You'll see "Drag table to union" area
4. Drop the second table there
5. Repeat for more tables

**Hands-On Example:**
- Excel file with sheets: Sales_Q1, Sales_Q2, Sales_Q3, Sales_Q4
- Each sheet has: Date, Product, Sales, Profit
- Union all four sheets

**B. Wildcard Union (Pattern Matching)**
**Steps:**
1. Drag first table to canvas
2. Click dropdown arrow on table name
3. Select **"Convert to Union"**
4. Choose **"Wildcard (automatic)"**
5. Enter pattern:
   - **Matching pattern:** Sales* (matches Sales_Q1, Sales_Q2, etc.)
   - **Sheet name:** Select specific sheets
6. Click **OK**

**Result Columns:**
- All original columns
- **Sheet** column (shows which sheet data came from)
- **Table Name** column

**Hands-On Practice:**
Create 3 Excel sheets:
- Jan_Sales: OrderID, Product, Amount
- Feb_Sales: OrderID, Product, Amount  
- Mar_Sales: OrderID, Product, Amount

Union them using wildcard pattern: "*Sales"

**Mismatched Columns:**
If tables have different columns:
- Union creates all columns
- Missing values filled with NULL
- Column names must match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Exam Scenario:**
> Q: You have 12 monthly Excel files. Each file has the same structure. What's the fastest way to combine them?
> A: Use Wildcard Union with appropriate pattern matching.

## 6. Joins

**What it is:** Combines tables horizontally (adds columns from related tables)

**When to use:**
- Tables have related data with common field(s)
- Need to combine information from multiple tables
- Example: Orders table + Customers table (join on Customer ID)

### Join Types:

**A. Inner Join**
- Returns only matching rows from both tables
- Most common join type
- **Symbol:** Overlapping circles (only intersection)

**B. Left Join**
- Returns all rows from left table + matching rows from right table
- Non-matching right rows show NULL
- **Symbol:** Left circle fully colored

**C. Right Join**
- Returns all rows from right table + matching rows from left table
- Non-matching left rows show NULL
- **Symbol:** Right circle fully colored

**D. Full Outer Join**
- Returns all rows from both tables
- Non-matching rows show NULL
- **Symbol:** Both circles fully colored

---

### Creating Joins:

**Steps:**
1. On Data Source page, drag first table to canvas
2. Drag second table BESIDE the first table (not below)
3. Join dialog appears automatically
4. Tableau suggests join fields (common column names)
5. Verify/modify join conditions:
   - Click **join icon** between tables
   - Select join type (Inner/Left/Right/Full Outer)
   - Add/remove join clauses
   - Choose fields to join on
   - Select operator (=, >, <, >=, <=, ≠)

**Hands-On Example:**

**Table 1: Orders**
| OrderID | CustomerID | Product | Amount |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1       | C001      | Chair   | 100    |
| 2       | C002      | Table   | 200    |
| 3       | C003      | Desk    | 150    |

**Table 2: Customers**
| CustomerID | CustomerName | City      |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| C001      | John        | New York  |
| C002      | Mary        | Boston    |
| C004      | Steve       | Chicago   |

**Practice each join type:**

**Inner Join (OrderID = CustomerID):**
- Result: 2 rows (C001, C002)
- C003 excluded (no customer match)
- C004 excluded (no order)

**Left Join:**
- Result: 3 rows
- C003 shows NULL for CustomerName and City
- C004 not included

**Right Join:**
- Result: 3 rows
- C004 included with NULL for Order fields
- C003 not included

**Full Outer:**
- Result: 4 rows
- Both C003 and C004 included with NULL for non-matching fields

---

### Multiple Joins:

**Steps:**
1. Add first two tables and create join
2. Drag third table to canvas
3. Choose which table to join with:
   - Join with left table
   - Join with right table
   - Join with combined result

**Complex Join Example:**
- Orders → Customers (CustomerID)
- Orders → Products (ProductID)
- Creates 3-table relationship

**Hands-On Practice:**
Create three tables:
- **Orders:** OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity
- **Customers:** CustomerID, Name, Region
- **Products:** ProductID, ProductName, Category

Join all three and create visualization

---

### Join Calculations:

You can join on calculated fields:

**Steps:**
1. Create join between tables
2. Click **"Add new join clause"**
3. Click dropdown → **"Create Join Calculation"**
4. Write calculation (e.g., `DATEPART('year', [Order Date])`)
5. Use calculated field in join

**Exam Scenario:**
> Q: You need to join tables where one has "First Name" and "Last Name" separate, and other has "Full Name". How?
> A: Create join calculation: `[First Name] + " " + [Last Name] = [Full Name]`

---

## 7. Data Blending Basics

**What it is:** Combines data from multiple data sources in a single view (alternative to joins)

**Difference from Joins:**
- **Joins:** Combine at data source level (same data source)
- **Blending:** Combine at worksheet level (different data sources)

**When to use:**
- Data from different databases
- Different levels of granularity
- No direct join possible
- Need flexibility per worksheet

**How it works:**
- **Primary Data Source:** Blue checkmark (first used in view)
- **Secondary Data Source:** Orange checkmark
- Tableau automatically finds common fields (shown with link icon)
- Blending happens on common dimensions

**Steps to Create Blend:**
1. Connect to first data source → Create visualization
2. Connect to second data source (Data → New Data Source)
3. Drag field from secondary source to view
4. Tableau automatically blends on common fields
5. To change blend relationship:
   - Data → **Edit Blend Relationships**
   - Select/deselect linking fields

**Hands-On Example:**

**Data Source 1: Sales (Excel)**
| Region | Product | Sales |
|--------|---------|-------|
| East   | Chairs  | 1000  |
| West   | Tables  | 1500  |

**Data Source 2: Targets (SQL)**
| Region | Target |
|--------|--------|
| East   | 1200   |
| West   | 1400   |

**Create Blended View:**
1. Connect to Sales → Drag Region, Sales to view
2. Connect to Targets
3. Drag Target to view
4. Tableau blends on Region (common field)
5. Result shows Sales vs Target by Region

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Blue checkmark:** Primary data source
- **Orange checkmark:** Secondary data source
- **Link icon:** Linked field (used for blending)
- **Broken link icon:** Field exists but not linked

**Blending Limitations:**
- Only LEFT join equivalent
- Cannot use secondary source dimensions in filters (except context filters)
- Aggregations on secondary source only
- Cannot create relationships like in data model

**Exam Tip:** If question asks "combine data from SQL Server and Excel in same view" → Use Data Blending

## Common Hands-On Exam Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Excel Sheets
**Task:** You have Sales_Jan.xlsx, Sales_Feb.xlsx, Sales_Mar.xlsx. Combine them.
**Solution:** 
- Option 1: Connect to each file → Union manually
- Option 2: Use Wildcard Union with pattern "Sales_*.xlsx"

### Scenario 2: Live vs Extract Decision
**Task:** 10GB database, updates nightly, dashboard used all day.
**Solution:** 
- Use Extract
- Schedule incremental refresh nightly
- Better performance for users

### Scenario 3: Messy Excel Data
**Task:** Excel file has 3 title rows, merged cells, summary row at bottom.
**Solution:** 
- Enable Data Interpreter
- Review results to confirm correct data

### Scenario 4: Related Tables
**Task:** Orders table (OrderID, CustomerID, Amount) and Customers table (CustomerID, Name, City). Show order amount by customer city.
**Solution:** 
- Join Orders and Customers on CustomerID
- Use Left Join (keep all orders)
- Create visualization with City and SUM(Amount)

### Scenario 5: Cross-Database Analysis
**Task:** Sales in SQL Server, Budget in Excel. Compare in one view.
**Solution:** 
- Connect to SQL Server (Sales)
- Connect to Excel (Budget)
- Use Data Blending on common dimension (e.g., Category or Date)
