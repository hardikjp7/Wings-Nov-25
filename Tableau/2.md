# MODULE 3: Working with Data

---

## **Topic 9: Data Aggregation & Granularity**

### **What is Aggregation?**

**Aggregation** = Combining multiple rows of data into a single summary value.

When you drag a **measure** to a view, Tableau **automatically aggregates** it. You see things like:
- SUM(Sales) - not just "Sales"
- AVG(Profit) - not just "Profit"
- COUNT(Orders) - not just "Orders"

---

### **Why Aggregation Matters:**

Raw data might have 10,000 rows:
```
Order ID | Customer | Product | Sales
1001     | John     | Chair   | 250
1002     | Mary     | Desk    | 800
1003     | John     | Lamp    | 50
...
```

When you create "Sales by Customer" chart:
- Tableau **aggregates** all of John's orders → Total
- Shows one bar per customer (not 10,000 bars)

---

### **Default Aggregation Types:**

| Aggregation | What It Does | When to Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **SUM** | Adds all values | Total revenue, quantities | Total Sales = $500K |
| **AVG** | Average of values | Mean performance | Average Order Value = $150 |
| **MEDIAN** | Middle value | Central tendency (less affected by outliers) | Median Salary = $60K |
| **COUNT** | Number of records | How many transactions | Order Count = 1,200 |
| **COUNT (DISTINCT)** | Unique values | Unique customers, products | Unique Customers = 450 |
| **MIN** | Smallest value | Lowest price, earliest date | Min Price = $5 |
| **MAX** | Largest value | Highest value, latest date | Max Discount = 40% |
| **STDEV** | Standard deviation | Data spread/volatility | Sales Volatility |
| **VAR** | Variance | Squared deviation | Price Variance |

---

### **How to Change Aggregation:**

**Method 1:** Right-click on measure pill → **Measure** → Select aggregation
**Method 2:** Click dropdown arrow on pill → Select aggregation
**Method 3:** Default aggregation in Data pane: Right-click field → **Default Properties** → **Aggregation**

---

### **Disaggregation (EXAM IMPORTANT!)**

Sometimes you want to see **every individual row** instead of aggregated data.

**How to Disaggregate:**
- **Analysis** menu → Uncheck **Aggregate Measures**
- OR: Right-click measure → **Disaggregate**

**When to disaggregate:**
- Scatter plots where each dot = one transaction
- Detailed analysis of individual records
- Finding outliers in raw data

**Example:**
- Aggregated: 4 regional bars showing total sales
- Disaggregated: Thousands of dots, each = one order

**Exam Trap:** "The chart shows too many marks, how to fix?" → **Aggregate measures** (turn aggregation back on)

---

### **What is Granularity?**

**Granularity** = The level of detail in your visualization

Think of it as zoom levels:
- **High Granularity (detailed):** Individual transactions, customers
- **Low Granularity (summarized):** Yearly totals, regional averages

**Granularity is determined by:**
- What dimensions are in your view
- What's in Rows, Columns, Detail, Color, etc.

---

### **Granularity Examples:**

**Scenario:** Sales data with Customer, Product, Order Date

**Low Granularity (Summarized):**
- View: Total Sales (no dimensions)
- Result: One number → $2.3M
- Granularity: Entire dataset

**Medium Granularity:**
- View: Sales by Year
- Result: 4 bars (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023)
- Granularity: Year level

**Higher Granularity:**
- View: Sales by Year and Category
- Result: 12 bars (4 years × 3 categories)
- Granularity: Year + Category level

**Highest Granularity:**
- View: Sales by Customer, Product, and Date
- Result: Thousands of marks
- Granularity: Transaction level

---

### **How Granularity Affects Calculations:**

**CRITICAL for scenario questions!**

**Example Dataset:**
```
Region | Product | Sales | Profit
East   | Chair   | 100   | 20
East   | Desk    | 200   | 40
West   | Chair   | 150   | 30
West   | Desk    | 250   | 50
```

**Question:** What is average profit?

**Depends on granularity!**

**Granularity 1: By Region**
```
East: Profit = (20+40) = 60
West: Profit = (30+50) = 80
Average = (60+80)/2 = 70
```

**Granularity 2: By Product**
```
Chair: Profit = (20+30) = 50
Desk: Profit = (40+50) = 90
Average = (50+90)/2 = 70
```

**Granularity 3: By Region AND Product**
```
Average = (20+40+30+50)/4 = 35
```

**Different granularity = Different answer!**

**Exam Pattern:** "Why do two views show different averages?" → Granularity difference

---

### **Controlling Granularity:**

**To increase granularity (more detail):**
- Add more dimensions to view (Rows, Columns, Detail)

**To decrease granularity (more summary):**
- Remove dimensions from view
- Use higher-level dimensions (Year instead of Date)
- Use aggregation

**Golden Rule:**
> **Granularity = All dimensions in your view (including Detail card)**

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** You have Sales by Customer chart showing 500 customers. You add Product to Detail. What happens?
- A) Chart stays the same ✅
- B) More bars appear
- C) Chart breaks
- D) Customers disappear

**Why?** Detail increases granularity but doesn't create visual splits. Each customer bar now represents sum across all products for that customer. If Product were added to Color, you'd see product splits.

---

**Q2:** Your chart shows AVG(Sales) = $500. Colleague's shows $350 for same data. Most likely reason?
- A) Wrong data connection
- B) Different granularity ✅
- C) Different date range
- D) Calculation error

**Why?** Averages are highly sensitive to granularity. Different dimensions in view = different averages.

---

**Q3:** You want to show each individual transaction as a dot. What should you do?
- A) Add more dimensions
- B) Disaggregate measures ✅
- C) Change to SUM
- D) Add to Detail

**Why?** Disaggregation shows every row; aggregation summarizes rows.

---

## **Topic 10: Sorting & Grouping**

### **Sorting in Tableau**

**Sorting** = Arranging marks in specific order

**Why sort?**
- Make patterns visible (highest to lowest)
- Alphabetical organization
- Custom business logic order

---

### **Types of Sorting:**

#### **1. Manual Sorting**
Drag and drop axis headers to reorder

**How:**
- Hover over axis label
- Drag to new position
- Good for: Small datasets, custom order

#### **2. Automatic Sorting**

**Method 1: Toolbar Sort Icons**
- Click sort ascending/descending icons in toolbar
- Select field to sort by

**Method 2: Click Axis**
- Click on axis (Column headers/Row headers)
- Choose sort option from menu

**Method 3: Sort Dialog**
- Right-click axis → Sort
- Opens detailed sort dialog

---

### **Sort Dialog Options:**

**Sort by:** (Most important choice)

**1. Data Source Order**
- Order as it appears in original data
- Rarely useful

**2. Alphabetic**
- A to Z or Z to A
- Good for: Names, categories

**3. Field (Manual)**
- Custom order you define
- Drag items in preferred sequence
- Good for: Month names, priority levels

**4. Field (Aggregated Measure)**
- Sort by calculation
- Example: Sort customers by Total Sales
- **Most common in business scenarios**

**Options:**
- Ascending/Descending
- Which field to sort by
- Which aggregation (SUM, AVG, etc.)

---

### **Nested Sorting (EXAM IMPORTANT!)**

When you have multiple dimensions, sorting becomes hierarchical.

**Example:**
Sales by Region and Category

**Primary sort:** Region (alphabetically)
**Secondary sort:** Category within each region (by Sales descending)

**How to achieve:**
1. Sort outer dimension first (Region)
2. Then sort inner dimension (Category)
3. Tableau maintains nested structure

**Common mistake:** Sorting only one level and expecting both to sort

---

### **Sorting Dates:**

Dates have natural order (chronological), but you can:
- Sort oldest to newest (default)
- Sort newest to oldest
- Sort by aggregated measure (e.g., sort months by sales)

**Exam scenario:** "Show months in order of highest sales" → Sort by SUM(Sales) descending, not chronological

---

### **Grouping in Tableau**

**Grouping** = Combining multiple dimension members into a single category

**Why group?**
- Simplify visualizations (too many categories)
- Create custom categories
- Correct data inconsistencies ("USA" and "United States")
- Business logic grouping

---

### **How to Create Groups:**

**Method 1: Select and Group (Visual)**
1. Select multiple marks in view (Ctrl+Click)
2. Click paperclip icon OR Right-click → **Group**
3. Tableau creates new grouped field

**Method 2: Data Pane**
1. Right-click dimension → **Create** → **Group**
2. Select members to group
3. Click **Group** button
4. Name the group

**Method 3: Field Menu**
1. In visualization, right-click axis label
2. Select **Create Group**

---

### **Group Features:**

**Include "Other"**
- Groups everything not explicitly grouped
- Toggle on/off in group dialog

**Multiple Groups in One Field**
- Group 1: "East Coast" = East + Southeast
- Group 2: "West Coast" = West + Southwest  
- Group 3: "Central" = Central + Midwest

**Edit Groups:**
- Right-click grouped field → **Edit Group**
- Add/remove members
- Rename groups

---

### **Groups vs Filters - Key Difference:**

❌ **Filter:** Removes data from view completely
✅ **Group:** Combines categories but keeps all data visible

**Example:**
- 10 product categories → Too many bars
- **Filter approach:** Show only top 5 (other 5 disappear)
- **Group approach:** Group bottom 5 as "Other Products" (all data visible, just combined)

---

### **Grouping Best Practices:**

✅ **Good uses:**
- Combining small categories into "Other"
- Regional groupings (Northeast, Southeast, etc.)
- Product line groupings
- Fixing data inconsistencies

❌ **Bad uses:**
- Grouping just to reduce bars (use filters instead if data isn't needed)
- Too many groups (defeats purpose of simplification)
- Grouping measures (group dimensions only)

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** You have 50 product categories showing as bars. You want to show top 10 individually and combine rest. Best approach?
- A) Filter to top 10 only
- B) Create group called "Other" for bottom 40 ✅
- C) Sort and ignore bottom 40
- D) Use multiple filters

**Why?** Grouping keeps all data visible; filtering removes data. Context matters: if stakeholders need to see total market, keep all data via grouping.

---

**Q2:** You want to sort products by profit margin (Profit/Sales) descending. How?
- A) Sort by SUM(Profit)
- B) Create calculated field for margin, sort by it ✅
- C) Sort alphabetically
- D) Manual sort

**Why?** Profit margin is a calculation, not a direct field. Must create calculated field first (we'll cover in Module 4), then sort by it.

---

**Q3:** Your Region dimension has inconsistencies: "North", "Northern", "N" all meaning same. Solution?
- A) Filter out inconsistent values
- B) Create group combining them ✅
- C) Manual sort
- D) Use aliases

**Why?** Both grouping and aliases work, but grouping is better when combining multiple values into one. Aliases (next topic) are for renaming individual values.

---

## **Topic 11: Sets & Hierarchies**

### **SETS in Tableau**

**Set** = Custom field that categorizes data as "In" or "Out" based on conditions

Think of sets as **dynamic groups** or **advanced filters** that create **binary** (Yes/No) segmentation.

---

### **Types of Sets:**

#### **1. Static Sets (Manual)**

You manually select which members are "In" the set.

**Example:**
- Create set "Focus Products" 
- Manually select: Chairs, Desks, Tables
- All other products are "Out"

**Doesn't change** unless you manually edit it.

---

#### **2. Dynamic Sets (Conditional)** ⭐ **EXAM FAVORITE**

Set membership determined by **conditions** that update automatically.

**Condition types:**

**A) By Field:**
- Based on dimension values
- Example: "Products containing 'Chair'"

**B) By Formula:**
- Based on calculation
- Example: `SUM([Sales]) > 10000`
- Products with >$10K sales are "In"

**C) Top/Bottom:**
- Top/Bottom N by measure
- Example: "Top 10 Customers by Sales"

**Automatically updates** when data changes!

---

### **How to Create Sets:**

**Method 1: From View**
1. Select marks (Ctrl+Click)
2. Right-click → **Create Set**
3. Name it
4. Configure condition (if dynamic)

**Method 2: From Data Pane**
1. Right-click dimension → **Create** → **Set**
2. Choose: General (manual), Condition, or Top
3. Configure and click OK

---

### **Using Sets in Visualizations:**

Once created, sets appear in Data pane (Sets section, bottom left).

**Drag set to view:**
- Shows two categories: **In** and **Out**
- Binary dimension

**Example:**
- Create set: "Top 10 Products by Sales"
- Drag to Color → Highlights top 10 vs rest
- Drag to Filter → Show only top 10

---

### **Sets vs Groups vs Filters:**

| Feature | Filter | Group | Set |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Removes data?** | Yes | No | No (unless used as filter) |
| **Dynamic updates?** | Can be | No | Yes (if conditional) |
| **Binary (In/Out)?** | N/A | No | Yes |
| **Multiple categories?** | N/A | Yes | No (only In/Out) |
| **Best for** | Removing data | Combining categories | Comparing segment vs rest |

---

### **Set Actions (Advanced - Exam Important!)**

Sets can be **interactive** on dashboards via **Set Actions**.

**Use case:**
- User clicks on a product → Adds it to "Selected Products" set
- Other sheets filter/highlight based on selection
- More dynamic than filter actions

*We'll cover this more in Module 6 (Dashboards)*

---

### **Combined Sets**

You can **combine two sets** using logic:

**Operations:**
- **Union (OR):** In Set A **OR** Set B
- **Intersection (AND):** In Set A **AND** Set B
- **Exclusion (XOR):** In Set A **OR** Set B but not both
- **Difference (A-B):** In Set A but NOT in Set B

**How:**
- Right-click set → **Create Combined Set**
- Select second set and operation

---

### **Scenario-Based Question:**

**Q1:** You need to highlight top 10 products dynamically as sales change. Best approach?
- A) Manual group of 10 products
- B) Filter to top 10
- C) Dynamic set with Top 10 condition ✅
- D) Sort by sales

**Why?** Dynamic set updates automatically; group is static. Filter removes other products; set keeps them visible but categorized.

---

**Q2:** You have set "High Value Customers" (>$5K sales). What does dragging it to Color do?
- A) Shows only high value customers
- B) Colors high value differently from others ✅
- C) Filters out low value customers
- D) Breaks the view

**Why?** Set on Color creates two-color encoding: In vs Out. To filter, must drag to Filters shelf.

---

### **HIERARCHIES in Tableau**

**Hierarchy** = Drill-down structure organizing dimensions from broad to specific

Think: Country → State → City → Zip Code

---

### **Why Use Hierarchies?**

✅ **Benefits:**
- Easy drill-down navigation
- Organized data structure
- Better user experience on dashboards
- Follows natural data relationships

**Example:**
- Start at Year level (2023)
- Click + to expand → Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Click + again → Months within quarters
- Click - to collapse back

---

### **Types of Hierarchies:**

#### **1. Automatic Date Hierarchy**

Tableau **automatically creates** date hierarchies:

```
Year
 └─ Quarter
     └─ Month
         └─ Day
```

**Already built-in** for date fields (no action needed)!

**How to use:**
- Drag date field to Rows/Columns
- Click +/- on pill to drill down/up
- Right-click to choose specific level

---

#### **2. Geographic Hierarchy**

For geographic fields with roles assigned:

```
Country
 └─ State
     └─ City
```

**How it works:**
- Tableau recognizes geographic fields (Country, State, City)
- Automatically creates hierarchy if data has proper relationships
- Can also create manually

---

#### **3. Custom Hierarchies**

You create your own based on business logic.

**Example - Product Hierarchy:**
```
Category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
 └─ Sub-Category (Chairs, Tables, Bookcases...)
     └─ Product Name (HON 5400 Series Task Chair...)
```

---

### **How to Create Custom Hierarchy:**

**Method 1: Drag and Drop**
1. In Data pane, drag one dimension onto another
2. "Create hierarchy" dialog appears
3. Name the hierarchy
4. Drag additional levels into hierarchy folder

**Method 2: Right-Click**
1. Right-click dimension → **Hierarchy** → **Create Hierarchy**
2. Name it
3. Drag other dimensions into created hierarchy folder

**Method 3: Multiple Selection**
1. Ctrl+Click multiple dimensions
2. Right-click → **Hierarchy** → **Create Hierarchy**

---

### **Working with Hierarchies:**

**In Data Pane:**
- Hierarchy appears as folder with triangle
- Expand to see levels inside

**In View:**
- Drag hierarchy to Rows/Columns
- Shows top level by default
- Click +/- to drill down/up
- Right-click to "Drill down to [specific level]"

**Removing from Hierarchy:**
- Drag field out of hierarchy folder
- Hierarchy remains, just loses that level

**Deleting Hierarchy:**
- Right-click hierarchy → **Remove Hierarchy**
- Fields return to normal (not deleted)

---

### **Drill-Down Navigation:**

**Click + (plus sign):**
- Expands to next level down
- Shows more detail

**Click - (minus sign):**
- Collapses to previous level
- Shows less detail

**Right-click header:**
- "Drill down to..." specific level
- Skip intermediate levels

---

### **Hierarchies in Dashboards (Important!):**

Hierarchies make dashboards **interactive** without actions:
- Users click + to explore
- Natural, intuitive navigation
- No configuration needed

**Example:**
- Dashboard shows Sales by Category
- User clicks + on "Furniture"
- Expands to show sub-categories within Furniture
- Click + on "Chairs" → Shows individual chair models

---

### **Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Create hierarchies that match business structure
- Use logical ordering (broad → specific)
- Limit to 3-4 levels (deeper = confusing)
- Test drill-down flow

❌ **DON'T:**
- Mix unrelated dimensions (Product + Region = illogical)
- Create unnecessary hierarchies (if rarely used)
- Make too many levels (overwhelming)

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** You want users to explore sales from Region → State → City. Best approach?
- A) Three separate filters
- B) Create geographic hierarchy ✅
- C) Three separate sheets
- D) Parameter

**Why?** Hierarchy enables drill-down navigation; filters are separate, not connected hierarchically.

---

**Q2:** In date hierarchy, user drills from Year → Quarter → Month. What happens to view?
- A) Replaces year with month
- B) Adds quarter and month columns, keeps year ✅
- C) Removes year, shows only month
- D) Creates error

**Why?** Drill-down **expands** hierarchy, showing nested structure. All levels remain visible.

---

**Q3:** Which is NOT a good hierarchy?
- A) Country → State → City
- B) Year → Quarter → Month
- C) Department → Employee
- D) Product → Customer ✅

**Why?** Product and Customer have no logical parent-child relationship. Hierarchies need clear containment logic.

---

## **Topic 12: Aliases & Data Formatting**

### **ALIASES in Tableau**

**Alias** = Alternative display name for dimension members

**Original value in data:** "CA"  
**Alias displayed in view:** "California"

Data itself **doesn't change**, only how it's **displayed**.

---

### **Why Use Aliases?**

✅ **Clean up abbreviations**
- "NY" → "New York"
- "TX" → "Texas"

✅ **Fix inconsistent naming**
- "United States" and "USA" → both show as "United States"

✅ **Add business-friendly names**
- "PROD_CAT_01" → "Furniture"
- "Q1" → "First Quarter"

✅ **Formatting improvements**
- "furniture" → "Furniture" (capitalization)
- "office_supplies" → "Office Supplies" (remove underscores)

---

### **How to Create Aliases:**

**Method 1: Edit Aliases Dialog**
1. Right-click dimension → **Aliases**
2. Edit each value's display name
3. Click OK

**Method 2: In-View Editing**
1. Right-click on axis header/mark
2. Select **Edit Alias**
3. Type new name
4. Press Enter

**Method 3: Default Properties**
1. Right-click field in Data pane
2. **Default Properties** → **Aliases**
3. Set default aliases for this field

---

### **Alias Features:**

**Bulk Editing:**
- Clear All: Removes all aliases
- Reset: Reverts to original
- From File: Import aliases from CSV

**Inheritance:**
- Aliases set on original field apply to copies
- Can override in specific instances

**No Data Change:**
- Calculations still use original values
- Only affects display

---

### **Common Use Cases:**

**1. Month Names:**
Original: `1, 2, 3, 4...`
Aliases: `January, February, March...`

**2. Product Codes:**
Original: `PROD-A1, PROD-B2...`
Aliases: `Premium Chair, Standard Desk...`

**3. Status Codes:**
Original: `0, 1, 2`
Aliases: `Pending, Approved, Rejected`

---

### **Aliases vs Groups:**

| Feature | Alias | Group |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Combines values?** | No | Yes |
| **Changes display name?** | Yes | Can rename group |
| **Reduces row count?** | No | Yes |
| **One-to-one?** | Yes (one value → one alias) | No (many values → one group) |

**When to use:**
- **Alias:** Just renaming (1:1)
- **Group:** Combining multiple into one (many:1)

---

### **DATA FORMATTING in Tableau**

**Formatting** = How data appears visually (fonts, colors, number styles, alignment)

**Two types:**
1. **Field-level formatting** - Applies wherever field is used
2. **View-level formatting** - Applies only to current sheet

---

### **Number Formatting:**

**Common formats:**
- **Number (Standard):** 1234.56
- **Number (Custom):** 1,234.56
- **Currency:** $1,234.56
- **Percentage:** 12.35%
- **Scientific:** 1.23E+03

**How to format:**
1. Right-click measure → **Format**
2. Format pane opens (left side)
3. Choose number format, decimal places

---

### **Format Pane Structure:**

**Three tabs:**

**1. Fields Tab**
- Applies to ALL instances of this field
- Pane → How it looks in visualization area
- Header → How it looks in column/row headers
- Tooltip → How it looks in hover tooltip

**2. Axes Tab**
- Format axis appearance
- Title, tick marks, gridlines
- Range (min/max values)

**3. Shading Tab**
- Alternating row shading
- Pane/header backgrounds

---

### **Font Formatting:**

- **Font family:** Arial, Tableau, etc.
- **Size:** 8pt, 10pt, 12pt...
- **Style:** Bold, Italic
- **Color:** Any RGB color
- **Alignment:** Left, Center, Right

**How to format:**
- Right-click field/axis → **Format**
- Or: **Format** menu → **Font**

---

### **Date Formatting:**

Dates can display many ways:

**Examples:**
- `11/4/2025`
- `November 4, 2025`
- `Nov-25`
- `11-2025`
- `2025-11-04`
- `Tuesday, November 4, 2025`

**How to format:**
1. Right-click date field → **Format**
2. Choose from preset formats
3. Or create custom format

---

### **Custom Number Format (Advanced):**

Use format strings like Excel:

**Syntax:** `positive;negative;zero`

**Examples:**

**Currency with 0 decimals:**
`$#,##0;($#,##0);$0`

**Percentage with 1 decimal:**
`0.0%`

**Custom text:**
`#,##0 "units";(#,##0) "units"`
- Shows: `1,250 units` or `(500) units` for negative

**Prefixes/Suffixes:**
`"Sales: $"#,##0.00`
- Shows: `Sales: $1,234.56`

---

### **Quick Formatting Shortcuts:**

**Right-click in view:**
- **Format:** Opens format pane for clicked element
- **Format [Field Name]:** Formats specific field

**Format menu (top):**
- **Workbook:** Default formats for entire workbook
- **Font:** Text formatting
- **Borders:** Cell borders
- **Lines:** Gridlines
- **Shading:** Background colors

---

### **Formatting Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Be consistent across dashboards
- Use currency symbols for money
- Format percentages as %
- Round to appropriate decimals
- Use clear, readable fonts

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-format (too many colors, fonts)
- Use tiny fonts (<8pt)
- Mix format styles inconsistently
- Format everything bold/colored

---

### **Default Properties (EXAM TIP!):**

Set **default formatting** for fields:

**Right-click field → Default Properties:**
- **Color:** Default color encoding
- **Shape:** Default shape
- **Sort:** Default sort order
- **Number Format:** Default number format
- **Aggregation:** Default aggregation (SUM, AVG, etc.)
- **Total Using:** How totals calculate
- **Comment:** Add field description

**Why useful:**
- Saves time (don't reformat every time)
- Ensures consistency
- Applies to all sheets using this field

---

### **Scenario-Based Questions:**

**Q1:** You have sales data showing as "1234567.89". You want "$1,234,567.89". Best approach?
- A) Create calculated field
- B) Format as Currency with 2 decimals ✅
- C) Create alias
- D) Use ROUND function

**Why?** This is purely a display issue, not a calculation issue. Formatting changes display without changing data.

---

**Q2:** Region field shows "NE", "SE", "MW" but you want "Northeast", "Southeast", "Midwest". Solution?
- A) Create calculated field with IF statements
- B) Create aliases ✅
- C) Format as text
- D) Create groups

**Why?** One-to-one renaming = aliases. Groups combine multiple values; calculated fields are overkill.

---

**Q3:** Every time you use Sales field, you want it formatted as currency. Best approach?
- A) Format each view individually
- B) Set default properties for Sales field ✅
- C) Create new calculated field
- D) Use workbook formatting

**Why?** Default properties apply field-level formatting globally, saving time and ensuring consistency.

---

## **MODULE 3 SUMMARY**

### **Key Takeaways:**

✅ **Aggregation** combines rows; granularity determines detail level

✅ **Sorting** organizes data; sort by measures for business insights

✅ **Groups** combine categories; **Sets** create dynamic In/Out segments

✅ **Hierarchies** enable drill-down navigation

✅ **Aliases** rename for display; **Formatting** controls appearance

---

### **Critical Exam Concepts:**

🎯 **Granularity affects calculations** - Same data, different granularity = different results

🎯 **Sets vs Groups** - Sets are dynamic and binary; groups are static and multi-category

🎯 **Hierarchies** - Enable drill-down without dashboard actions

🎯 **Default properties** - Save time and ensure consistency

🎯 **Format vs Calculate** - Display problems use formatting; value problems use calculations

---

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

❌ Not understanding why averages differ (granularity issue)
❌ Using filters when groups/sets are better
❌ Creating flat dimensions when hierarchies make sense
❌ Using calculated fields for simple renaming (use aliases)
❌ Inconsistent formatting across dashboard

---

### **Self-Check Questions:**

Before moving to Module 4, can you answer:

1. Why might AVG(Sales) show differently in two views of same data?
2. When would you use a set instead of a group?
3. What's the difference between sorting by field vs sorting by aggregation?
4. When to use alias vs group vs calculated field for renaming?
